## Single directory components

Single Directory components can work seamlessly with components contrib module.
We can convert one by one to SDC once we convert the css for that component is unbundled from the `dist/styles.css` and
gets included as a SDC component
We can refer to other SDC components from within other components, we do not need to update everything to use slots.
